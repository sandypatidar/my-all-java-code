coupling: -
what is coupling :- degree of dependancy between the components is called coupling 

if dependancy is more then it is considerd as tightly coupling 
if dependancy is less then it is considerd as lossly coupling 

tightly couping is worst type of programing practice

hence we have to mantain dependance b/w the components as less as posible that is lossely coupling is a good programing practice

cohesion:- 

every component a clear well define functionality is defind then that component is set to be follow high cohesion
